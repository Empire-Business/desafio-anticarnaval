## PÁGINA DE INSCRIÇÃO

### 1. Hero Section - Principal

```
CONTEÚDO DO PROMPT (máx 300 palavras):

A professional motivational hero image featuring a confident Brazilian entrepreneur man in his 30s-40s with a well-groomed beard, wearing smart casual business attire (dark button-down shirt, sleeves rolled up), sitting at a modern home office desk with an open notebook and laptop. He has a determined, focused expression, looking directly at the camera with inspiring confidence. The background shows a dark room with warm accent lighting. Outside a window in the background, very subtle and blurred: silhouettes of people in carnival costumes, colorful lights faintly visible - representing the carnival happening "out there" while he focuses on growth "in here." A few golden confetti particles fall subtly in the foreground. Overlay text in bold modern typography: "RETIRO ANTICARNAVAL" (large, golden), "4 dias. 0 carnaval. 100% crescimento." (white, medium). The company logo appears discreetly in the bottom right corner. Color palette: black background, golden accents, white text. Mood: focused determination, anti-carnaval positioning, professional ambition.

In the far background through a window, extremely blurred: colorful carnival lights and faint silhouettes of people celebrating - creating contrast between the party "out there" and his frustration "in here."
