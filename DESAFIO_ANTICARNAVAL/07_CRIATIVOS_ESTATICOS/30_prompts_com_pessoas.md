A motivational Instagram promotional graphic featuring a professional Brazilian entrepreneur man in his 30s-40s with a well-groomed beard, wearing smart casual business attire, sitting confidently in a modern home office.

Overlay text in Portuguese: "RETIRO ANTICARNAVAL" in large golden letters at top, "EM 4 DIAS, SAIA COM SEU POSICIONAMENTO DEFINIDO" in white below, and "14-17 MAR • GRATUITO" at bottom. The company logo appears discreetly in the bottom right corner, 15% width, 80% opacity. Black background with dramatic side lighting creating depth.

Three bullet points in white: "→ Aula pela manhã → Tarefa durante o dia → Retorno à tarde." Bottom text: "Enquanto o mundo está no carnaval, você avança."

Large headline text: "EMPRESÁRIO COM AUTORIDADE NO MUNDO REAL" in white. Golden continuation: "E quer ampliar para o digital?" Three checkmark points in white: "✓ Já tem resultado offline ✓ Quer autoridade digital ✓ Está disposto a trabalhar" Bottom CTA in golden: "RETIRO ANTICARNAVAL • 14-17 MAR • GRATUITO."

Supporting text: "No Retiro Anti-Carnaval, você aprende o que separa você deles." Company logo discreetly placed.
